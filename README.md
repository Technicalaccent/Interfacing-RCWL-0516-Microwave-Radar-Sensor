Proximity sensing is a common application for intruder alarms, light switches, and other home and industrial automation applications. There are multiple methods of proximity detection used in the electronics industry. The most common method is to use the PIR sensor, which senses the change in ambient infrared radiation caused by a warm body.  And other common methods involve using reflected ultrasonic or light beams, in which the intruding object reflects the beam back to its source where the time delay between transmission and reception is measured to calculate the distance to the object.
